## Overview
**Pandora's Toolbox** is a part mod adding geometric primitives to the Creature Editor.

## Features

### Contents
The mod currently contains *9* unique shapes, with a further 12 being prepared for future updates (@ March 21, '23), and more in concept. All parts are highly morphable, with between 6 and 8 morph handles each, at minimum including scaling on independent X/Y/Z axes, and also including a Nudge / Depth Handle (*).

(*) *This feature is, currently, only accessible in the Creature Editor when [Dark Injection](https://davoonline.com/sporemodder/rob55rod/DarkInjection/)'s __foundational packages__ are installed (no additional content added by that mod is required to be active).*

Currently available are:

* Platonic Solids
  * Cube / Hexahedron / Rectangular Prism. Morphable into variously a triangular, rectangular or trapezoildal prisma and a rectangular-based pyramid.
  * Coming Soon:
    * Tetrahedron / Triangular-pyramid.
    * Octohedron / Double rectangular-pyramid.
    * Decahedron / Double pentagonal-pyramid.
    * Dodecahedron / Hexagonal-faced sphere.
    * Icosahedron / Triangle-faced sphere.
    * Variant Cube? Different morphs?

* Prisms
  * Conventional Cylinder / Icosidodecagonal (32-sided) prism. Morphable at both bases and in middle, into a cone or double-cone.
  * Half-Cylinder. Ditto with flat face.
  * Hexagonal Prism.
  * Bendable Cylinder / Icosidodecagonal prism (32 segments). Highly flexible, X/Y bending directions, twist bend and variable taper.
  * Coming Soon:
    * Bendable Rectangular Prism. Curved panels.
    * Standard Polygonal Prisms (Triangular, Pentagonal, etc.)
    * Variant Conventional Cylinder? Different morphs?

* Pipes
  * Cylindrical / Icosidodecagonal pipe. Morphable aperture, independent X/Y stretching.
  * Rectangular pipe. Ditto.
  * Coming Soon:
    * Gears. Both Even-toothed and Odd-toothed, including inner radius morphing, crowning and tooth sharpness modifier.
    * Standard Polygonal Pipes?
    * Bendable Pipes?
    
* Spheroids
  * Sphere. Highly morphable, including banana, cuboidal and teardrop shapes.
  * Half-Sphere. Ditto with flat face.
  * Coming Soon:
    * Hollow Half-Sphere / Cup / Shell. Independent interior scaling on X/Y/Z axes. 

* Toroids
  * Torus / Ring. Includes girth modifier, chainlink shape and sawtooth deformation.
  * Coming Soon:
    * Half-Torus?
    * Simplified Torus?

### Parts Mode Colour
Each currently available part has been given an independent model that will display the colour of the part accurately to how it would appear in Paint Mode, Test Drive and in-game. Due to limitations, however, this imposes a significant bloat in filesize, at least until a more quitable solution can be found. 

### Compatability Version
Due to early mistakes in handling, several instances of version incompatability have occured. At present, the only thus-far successful fix is only available for Pandora's Toolbox v. 1.0.1, an update to which will be included with every 2.x release.

This compatability version does *not* as of writing (@ March 21, '23) contain alterations to the existing Sphere parts.
